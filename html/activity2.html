	<h2>Employment History</h2>
	<p>After graduating from University, I was hired as a lecturer at a cram school where mainly elementary and junior high school students study different subjects such as Japanese, Math, English, Science, and Social Studies. I was in charge of teaching English and Social Studies. <br>
	After working for the cram school for two years, I enrolled in a graduate school to get a teaching certificate which allows me to work at public schools. At the graduate school, I took courses to become an English teacher at school.<br>
	After studying at the graduate school, I started to work as an English teacher at a middle school. I taught English in total three schools and quit the job to become a web developer. Even while working as a teacher, I was studying programming in an online school and came to think that I want to do programming as a job. <br>
	In order to earn money for my living while studying English, I worked as a data entry administrator as a freelancer. After getting an offer from the company I'm currently working for, I quit the date entry job and moved to the Philippines to work for the company. I want to become a web developer who can contribute this company.</p>

	<h2>Education</h2>
	<p>After graduating from high school, I enrolled in Kagawa University majoring in Economics. Aside from studying the subject, I belonged to the tennis team in University. <br>
	After graduating from the university, I worked as a lecturer at a cram school and enrolled in Ehime University as a graduate student to get a teaching certificate that allows me to teach at public schools. During the three years as a graduate student, I talked with many international students and studied English to pass exams. I was able to get good results in the Toeic test and the Eiken test. <br>
	As for programming, I studied the basics of HTML, CSS, and PHP in an online school. I want to improve my programming skills in order to contribute this company as a web developer.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Interest</h2>
	<p>There are three interests.<br>
	The first one is to visit many places. Eating local food and going to famous sightseeing posts are fun, but what I like more is to talk with local people at the place I visit. Since I like to talk with non-Japanese people, I also like to study foreign languages especially English. While staying in the Philippines, I want to visit many kinds of places and talk with many people to learn about their culture.<br> 
	The second one is to do exercises in the gym.
	When I was a teenager, I was very thin and I didn't like my body shape. To change my body shape, I started to do exercises in gym and I've been doing it more than five years. I don't really compete with someone, so weight training seems to be a good sport item for me. I will keep this routine to make my body bigger and to keep myself healthy. I also want to go to many gyms in the Philippines.<br>
	The third one is to cook healthy meals. I really don't care about the tastes of meals but care about the ingredients and nutrition. It's really fun for me to go to different grocery stores looking for ingredients being used for my meals. I want to visit wet markets in the Philippines as well.</p>
